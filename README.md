Basic K-Means Clustering of issues from a given GitHub repo.

Usage:
 - make sure all packages in `requirements.txt` are satisfied
 - generate authkey from github, place into authkeys.py file (placeholder key is invalid)
 - run script with `python gissues.py`


Might look into using LSTMs to summarize issue topics later on.
